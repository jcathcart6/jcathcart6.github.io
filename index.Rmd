Hello my name is Jacob Cathcart and I am a senior Mathmatics major at Appalachian State University graduating in December. I am apart of a family of 13 counting 3 biological siblings an adopted brother and 4 step siblings. I used to spend my summers at a summer camp where I developed a passion for sailing.
